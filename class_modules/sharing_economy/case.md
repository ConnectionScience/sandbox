There is a small company that a few students started, after making a bare-bones implementation at a hackathon. It's focused on sharing small boats (under 20 feet)1, which are very expensive and used infrequently, even during the season.2 Boat owners sign up with the app via smartphone or website(user-friendliness is important given the advanced age of many boat owners), post descriptions of their boat, and can then rent it out, generally a day at a time. 

1. Such boats can generally be manned by one or two hobbyists, and can support between four and eight people inside.

2. In New England, sailing is possible throughout the year, but in only a few months is it popular recreationally.
